## Data Foundation
- **`BP_GameDataSubsystem` (Engine Subsystem)**  
  Loads every DataTable on Init, builds caches keyed by ULID and slug, exposes helper functions (`GetStatById`, `GetItemModifiers`, `FindEncountersForLocation`). Provides typed wrappers for JSON fields (e.g. quest objective arrays). Emits validation logs when lookups miss.

- **`BP_DataImportManager` (Editor Utility Widget)**  
  Batch re-imports CSV/JSON exports, validates enum strings, checks dangling ULIDs, and can trigger automation tests. Presents a summary panel grouped by severity (error/warning/info). Supports hot reload during PIE for dialogue/narrative iteration.

- **`BP_ContentPackRegistry` (Game Instance Subsystem)**  
  Stores active packs, exposes `IsPackActive`, `FilterRowsByPack`, and broadcast events when pack selection changes (allowing UI or story systems to refresh).

- **`BP_CurrencyManager` (Game Instance Subsystem)**  
  Mirrors currency definitions, tracks player balances per currency, and provides mutators (`AddCurrency`, `RemoveCurrency`, `GetBalance`). Integrates with rewards, shop purchases, and save/load.

- **`BP_PersistenceValidator` (Auxiliary Subsystem)**  
  Verifies SaveGame snapshots against current data revisions, warning if removed quests/items/flags exist. Invoked post-load and after re-imports.

## Narrative & Game State
- **`BP_FlagManager` (Game Instance Subsystem)**  
  Initialises all flags to default values, exposes `CheckRequirement`, `SetFlag`, `GetFlagValue`, iterates link tables (required/forbidden flags, faction thresholds). Broadcasts `OnFlagChanged (FlagId, OldValue, NewValue)`; other systems subscribe.

- **`BP_ReputationSystem` (Game Instance Subsystem)**  
  Keeps faction reputation maps, applies modifiers from quests/events/encounters, and exposes threshold queries used by requirements.

- **`BP_QuestLogComponent` (Actor Component on Player)`**  
  Tracks quest states, objectives, timers. Subscribes to flag changes and updates UI. Calls into reward systems when objectives complete. Persists progress via SaveGame.

- **`BP_StoryManager` (Actor Component on GameMode)**  
  Drives story arc progression, timeline advancement, and event chains. Applies pack gating, requirement checks, and triggers new quests or events based on flag changes.

- **`BP_CompanionManager` (Game Instance Subsystem)**  
  Handles companion roster, spawns/despawns follower pawns, manages loyalty flags, communicates loadout/stats to combat setup. Supports rotating companions per story beat.

- **`BP_SaveGame_SoA` (SaveGame Blueprint)**  
  Serialises player stats, inventory, learned abilities, flags, quest states, companion roster, unlocked routes, content pack selection, travel seeds.

## World Graph & Travel
- **`BP_WorldGraphSubsystem` (World Subsystem)**  
  Ingests Location + LocationRoute tables, builds adjacency lists and weighted graph metadata. Provides pathfinding (`FindBestRoute` / `FindAllRoutes`), caches results per travel mode, and reacts to flag/content pack changes to enable/disable edges.

- **`BP_TravelPlanner` (Object Library / Blueprint Function Library)**  
  Executes Dijkstra/A* using data from the world graph, returning `FTravelPlan` structs (segments, estimated time, stamina costs, encounter odds). Supports developer overrides (instant travel, ignore requirements).

- **`BP_LocationRegistry` (World Subsystem)**  
  Tracks current location, discovered nodes, fast-travel unlocks, respawn anchors, and exposure to safe zones. Offers `GetLocationData`, `IsLocationUnlocked`, `MarkDiscovered`.

- **`BP_TravelOrchestrator` (World Subsystem or Component on Player Controller)**  
  Manages travel execution: steps through travel plan segments, triggers pre-segment events, rolls for encounters, plays travel UI/VO, and resumes control after each segment. Works with `BP_EncounterManager` for encounter injection.

- **`BP_WorldMapWidget` (UI)**  
  Renders nodes/edges, colour-codes locked routes, shows encounter odds and travel costs. Integrates developer debug modes for graph visualisation.

## Encounter & Combat Layer
- **`BP_EncounterManager` (World Subsystem)**  
  Receives context from travel/events, filters encounter candidates by requirement, content pack, and difficulty, seeds RNG for deterministic runs, and forwards selected encounters to the event sequencer or combat director.

- **`BP_EncounterDirector` (World Subsystem)**  
  Builds combat scenes: spawns player + companions, instantiates enemies using `FEnemyData` and `FCharacterClassData`, applies route/environment modifiers (weather, terrain), and packages `FCombatContext`.

- **`BP_TurnManager` (Actor/Component inside Battle Level)**  
  Orders combatants by Speed, handles initiative modifiers, queues actions, and drives the turn loop. Publishes turn order to UI and handles skip logic (stun, death).

- **`BP_ActionQueue` (Support Object)**  
  Stores declared actions, allows preview/confirmation, supports reaction hooks (interrupts, counters) configured via data.

- **`BP_EffectResolver` (Blueprint Function Library)**  
  Applies damage/heal/buff/debuff effects using `value_type`, `attribute_id`, and `scaling_stat_id`. Interfaces with `BP_CombatFormulaLibrary` for calculations and `BP_StatusComponent` for persistent states.

- **`BP_StatusComponent` (Actor Component on Battle Characters)**  
  Manages timed effects, stacking, immunities, and tick-based damage. Emits events for UI/AI when states change.

- **`BP_CombatFormulaLibrary` (Function Library)**  
  Centralises formulas (damage, crit, resistance), pulling coefficients from DataTables so balancing can change without blueprint rewiring.

- **`BP_BattleCharacter` / `BP_PlayerCharacter` / `BP_EnemyCharacter` / `BP_CompanionCharacter`**  
  Base combatant class plus specialisations. Provide API for stats, abilities, item usage, AI hooks, animation triggers.

- **`BP_EnemyBrain` (Actor Component)**  
  Wraps AI behaviour for enemies. Consumes behaviour tags from enemy data, scores abilities against current battlefield state, and picks targets.

- **`BP_RewardDistributor` (Function Library)**  
  Routes XP, currency, items, reputation, and flags after combat or scripted events through `BP_CurrencyManager`, `BP_ItemManager`, `BP_ReputationSystem`, and `BP_FlagManager`.

## Dialogue, Events & Interactions
- **`BP_DialogueManager` (Widget + Actor Component)**  
  Plays dialogues from `FDialogueData` + `FDialogueNodeData`, validates requirements per node using `BP_FlagManager`, pushes flags/rewards, and supports skip/debug options.

- **`BP_DialogueSpeaker`**  
  Maps speaker identifiers to character references (player, companion, NPC) and triggers VO/subtitles/emotes.

- **`BP_EventSequencer` (Subsystem)**  
  Reads `FEventData`, resolves requirements, fires target actions (encounter, dialogue, teleport, scripted scene), applies rewards, and follows `next_event_id` chains. Used by travel, story, and encounter systems.

- **`BP_ShopController` / `BP_ShopWidget`**  
  Validates access requirements, pulls inventory, calculates prices via pricing helper, processes purchases, updates currency manager.

- **`BP_LoreCompendium` (Subsystem/UI)**  
  Unlocks lore entries when flags/events trigger, references timelines for chronology filters.

## Tooling, Debug & QA
- **`BP_SoACheatManager`**  
  Exposes commands (`SpawnEncounter`, `ToggleEncounters`, `SetFlag`, `GiveItem`, `DebugLookupRow`, `UnlockRoute`, `TravelTo`, etc.). Only active in Development builds.

- **`BP_DebugOverlayWidget`**  
  UI for toggling cheats, viewing travel graph, inspecting current requirements, visualising encounter odds and turn order predictions.

- **Automation Tests (Blueprint-based)**  
  - Data integrity suite (per-table row validation, dangling ULIDs, enum mismatches).  
  - Requirement evaluation tests (required/forbidden flags, faction thresholds).  
  - Travel graph tests (ensure every route endpoint exists, detect cycles/orphans, validate safe-zone exclusions).  
  - Encounter seeding tests (consistent output for given seed + location).  

- **`BP_TravelSimulator` (Editor Utility)**  
  Runs Monte-Carlo simulations over travel paths to report encounter frequency, average cost/time, and edge cases (e.g. zero available routes). Helps tuning encounter chances.

- **`BP_TestBattleMode`**  
  Loads selected encounters, companions, equipment sets for rapid combat iteration; integrates with automation to catch regressions in formulas or AI.

Stick to these ownership boundaries to limit blueprint complexity. When in doubt, prefer adding data to the relevant table and letting the owning subsystem react, rather than special-casing logic in gameplay blueprints.
